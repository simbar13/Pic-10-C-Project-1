This code will play the game Siete y Medio against a computer.  This game is very similar to BlackJack, but is played to a score of 7.5 instead of 21, and with a spanish deck of cards.

Additionally, the program will create a text file called gamelog.txt which contains basic information about each game being played.  

Example games/test cases will be added below.
